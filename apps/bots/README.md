# Manga Reader Bots

This module contains various bots and automation scripts for the Manga Reader project, focusing on content ingestion and processing.

## Core Scripts

### Manual Uploader/Sample Script (`src/sample.ts`)
A recovery and maintenance script used to process existing local data.
- **Purpose**: Ideal for situations where the crawler was interrupted after downloading but before uploading.
- **Sample Data**: Refer to `sample-downloads/sample.json` for the expected JSON metadata structure.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Scans the `downloads/` directory for existing folder structures.
  - **Auto-Repair**:
    - If `images.zip` is missing but image files exist, it re-compiles the ZIP.
    - If `cover.webp` is missing, it reconstructs it from the first page of the gallery.
  - Re-validates metadata against current business rules (filters) before pushing to the server.
  - Utilizes the same `pushIntoWebsite` utility as the crawler for consistency.

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime installed.
2. **Setup**: Ensure environment variables and `src/utils/config.ts` are correctly pointed to your Manga Reader API instance.
3. **Execution**:
   ```bash
   # Process and upload existing downloads manually
   bun run src/sample.ts
   ```
